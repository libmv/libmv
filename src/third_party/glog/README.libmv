Upstream version: 0.2.1
Local modifications:

* The config_linux.h is generated by configure on Keir's Ubuntu 9.04 desktop.
* Commented out some struct ::tm weirdness causing compile failures on
  ubuntu 8.10 and 9.04.
* Switched several initializers to memset instead of = {}.
* Changed some includes pointing to gflags. Not sure why the regular inclusion
  didn't work.
* Added some compile flags to silence various warnings, allowing us to keep the
  differences between upstream small.
* Don't redefine _XOPEN_SOURCE.
* Added "google::" to GetReferenceableValue in CHECK_OP_LOG.

Old changes which got obsoleted (maybe?) by 0.2.1 merge:
* Added #ifndef / def REG_EIP; not sure what that is.
* Added (void) arg stuff to prevent unused variable warnings.
* Added google:: namespace prefix to GetReferencableValue
* Added assignments for several functions marked with no_ignore_return, where
  the return value was ignored.
* Commented out the unused function DumpPCAndSymbol() in utilities.cc to silent
  gcc on the mac

TODO(keir): Remove any obsoleted changes above if they are not necessary after
testing on more platforms.

WARNING: Mac port not updated for 0.2.1
