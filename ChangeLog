	  mode.
	* multiview: Add unfinished to/from methods for a rank-2 parameterization of the

	* ui: Apply cgv9999's patch. This fixes Issue 13.
	* numeric: Make it work on the mac (Leopard).
	* image: Fix some type problems in SURF. When using unsigned int type for the
	  integral image, many internal types became unsigned int which was causing
	  problems. Internal computations such as BlobResponse or HarrX need floating
	  point scalars regardless of the type of the integral image.
	* base: Size of vector - unsigned, MSVC complains about signed > unsigned
	  comparison in reserve()
	* multiview: Fix AutocalibrationLinear. There was an error when computing the
	  transformation from the absolute quadric. Also, the code for computing

	  instead of SBA. Actually added the multiview/bundle* files which i forgot to
	  upload before.
	* Add a comment on the current license issue.
	* ui: Add precarious bundle adjustment functions calling sba. This will probably
	  disapear, or severely evolve, when we start using some reconstruction data
	  structure, but I wanted to try something fast. The main, and important,
	  limitation of the current functions is that all points have to be visible in all
	  images. Additionally, in practice it does not work in presence of outliers.
	* multiview: Make tvr use the exhaustive search method for focal estimation, since
	  it is more stable.
	* multiview: Add function for estimating a common focal lenght of an image pair by
	  minimizing the reprojection error as suggested by Peter Sturm. The minimum is
	  found by a first exhaustive search, and then a golden ratio search.
	* multiview: Add functions for estimating homographies using DLT and RANSAC.
	* ui: Add SceneCamera to the graph. Mixed SceneImage with SceneCamera so that
	  images are rendered in the base of the camera pyramid.
	* ui: Implemented a simple trackball. Mouse rotation is now more intuitive in the
	  3d viewer, but should be improved by setting the revolve point to a suitable
	  position. Translation and zoom also need improvements.
	* ui: Removed global transform matrix from scene_graph_simple, uses OpenGL's
	  transform stack instead. Added a test for SetName which fails. Fixed memory leak
	  in LRUCache, and documented complexity (to the best of my ability). Removed
	  redundant code from 3DViewer.
	* ui: Add ViewerCamera no facilitate the implementation of the trackball.
	* optimize: Add simple automatic differentiation module.
	* third_party: Fix ignore properties.
	* third_party: Expand SBA README.
	* third_party: Add sba to the build process. Add hack to work around a problem in
	  debians f2c. Thanks to CMake, this was the easiest build integration I've ever
	  done.
	* third_party: First checkin of upstream sba 1.5. No local modifications yet; just
	  the tarball contents.
	* ui: Changed Tvr to use the simpler scene graph and now transformation works [=
	* scene_graph: Bug Fixes to scene_graph_simple.
	* ui: The 3d viewer show the point cloud now, but orbiting using the mouse does no
	  work.

	* scene_graph: Formatting
	* multiview: Skeleton for reconstruction; use cases identified.
	* ui: TVR no longer uses the same image positions for each 2D subwindow and fixed
	  the updategl hack with signals.

	* image: Add support for PNG read/write, by Daniel Waterworth.
	* multiview: Fixed computation of the center of the image.
	* correspondence: Fix comments.
	* multiview: added include to fix compilation error
	* correspondence: Add support for iterating over the features for a track that
	  appears in all of a set of images, and has a specific type.

	  line that I had deleted before.
	* ui: Add save to blender script. The code is a copy--paste from libmv1 branch.
	  The cameras are not yet correctly placed, but we get a nice 3D point cloud XD
	* multiview: Add action for compting metric reconstruction in tvr. Nothing to
	  display it or save it yet.
	* correspondence: Undo unwanted changes.

	* multiview: Added action to compute focal from fundamental matrix using Hartley's
	  method to tvr.
	* correspondence: Highlighted a trick to be fixed.
	* multiview: Removed linear constraints enforcing calibration constantness, since
	  they where wrong. The image of the absolute quadric is constant between frames,
	  but only up to scale. This gives quadratic equations on the DAQ and not the
	  linear ones I naively introduced :-(
	* multiview: Add draft for linear autocalibration. It is working for 3 noiseless
	  projection matrices.
	* correspondence: Add support for iterating over tracks which appear in all of a
	  given set of images.
	* correspondence: Formatting.

	* Added a target to the Makefile so that it can build a Kdevelop project.
	* image: Include libmv/logging instead of third_party/glog.
	* multiview: Fixed robust_fundamental tests. There was a cast (in
	  robust_estamation.h) from double to int, that was giving negative numbers of
	  iterations out of huge possitive doubles. This was stopping RANSAC too soon.
	* multiview: Fixed first robust_fundamental test.
	* multiview: Added SymmetricEpipolarDistance (mainly to test SampsonDistance).
	* multiview: Moved and fixed Sampson Distance. Robust fundamental test is still
	  failing.
	* correspondence: Fixed kd-tree test in release mode.
	* ui: Rearrange feature.h/cc to be more useful, and push it into the tvr program.

	  namespace to parts of CHECK_EQ macro.
	* correspondence: Comments.
	* Remove lapack stuff from README.

	* multiview: Change how max iterations are calculated in robust estimation.
	* numeric: Fix uninitialized variable in dogleg.
	* Add David Roberts and James MacLean to AUTHORS.
	* multiview: Added an optional parameter to RANSAC Estimate, so that it can return
	  the list of inliers. Now, a test in robust_fundamental is failing because some
	  inliers are not included in the list.
	* third_party: Fix a minor warning in Eigen. A variable was only used in and
	  assert statement and unused in release mode.
	* image: Fixed uninitialized variable in surf_descriptor. Surf matching works now!
	* ui: TVR computes now matches between the two images using the kd-tree. Some of
	  the code will have to move to libmv/correspondence.
	* ui: Link UI against OpenGL libraries to fix compile error
	* correspondence: Added single nearest neighbor search function.
	* multiview: Created autocalibration.* and moved K_From_AbsoluteConic there.
	* ui: TVR can now compute and display USURF features.
	* ui: In MatchViewer, images can now be dragged using the shift key.
	* ui: Add starting files for the two view reconstruction gui app. For now it
	  enables to load 2 images, display them side by side, scroling and zooming. It
	  has been ported from pau's branch.
	* ui: Removed old scons file.
	* correspondence: Added a stoping criteria to knn search.
	* multiview: Added function for computing K from the image of the absolute conic.

	* third_party: More fixes to make thing compile on Ubuntu 8.10.
	* third_party: Small changes to (hopefully) fix compiles on other platforms.
	* correspondence: Added best bin first approximate nearest neighbor search. The
	  stopping condition to end the search is missing.
	* numeric: Fix a units error in dogleg; now for the simple test case, dogleg
	  converges faster than LM. Still need to add support for singular normal
	  equations to pass the second test.
	* numeric: Dogleg code compiles and passes a simple test but fails on a harder
	  one.
	* image: Modified image_io.cc to handle comments in PGM/PPM images.
	* numeric: Add unfinished dogleg nonlinear minimizer (not in build system yet).
	* numeric: Minor LM change.
	* correspondence: Minor reformatting in correspondence module.
	* logging: Logging header.
	* tools: Make tools use libmv::Init().
	* tools (lib): Add a logging header.
	* numeric: Make LM parameters settable. The API is fairly usable now; probably
	  dogleg is next.

	* image: Add minor optimization to BlobResponse() by removing bounds checking in
	  IntegralImage. Minor logging fixes.
	* image: Fix gaussian scale computation. Add more criteria to reject surf interest
	  points when solving hessian fails. Start renaming magic values to variables
	  parameter_XXXXX so that parameters can be found with grep.
	* image: Add multiscale SURF interest point detection. Refactor
	  non-maximal-suppression. The interest points are a bit suspect however, which
	  bears more investigation.

	* numeric: Make LM code into an object. Make numeric jacobian evaluation into a
	  class as well.

	* numeric: Add missed file.
	* ui: Switch libmv to use Eigen2 instead of FLENS.
	* third_party: Add eigen2 to third_party
	* third_party: Use macros for the tests (much shorter). Use FindBLAS and
	  FindLAPACK to more intelligently select lapack and blas libraries, though they
	  are still not perfect.
	* multiview: Switched EssentialFromRt to use general matrices. It was giving nans
	  on the mac.
	* multiview: Finished TwoViewReconstruction test. Found a very misterious and
	  difficult to reproduce bug in RelativeCameraMotion, and switched it to general
	  matrix.
	* multiview: Finish motion from essential matrix. The right solution is choosen by
	  requiring a triangulated feature to be in front of the cameras.
	* multiview: Add triangulation using DLT from libmv1.
	* multiview: Fix and test MotionFromEssential.
	* multiview: Added untested motion computation from the essential matrix.
	* numeric: Added two FLENS feature requests.
	* numeric: Added Essential matrix computation.
	* numeric: TwoViewReconstruction test working! Motion and structure computation
	  still missing.
	* multiview: Separated data sets from tests.
	* third_party: Implement tiny vector scaling. Implement operator== for tiny
	  matrices.
	* third_party: Make matrix multiplication between tiny and general matrices work.
	  The implementation is nasty; patches to improve it welcome.
	* third_party: Add operator== for general FLENS matrices, for easier tests like
	  EXPECT_EQ(A, B) where A and B are flens matrices.

	* numeric: Added stacking functions and a FLENS crashing example.
	* multiview: Switched the meaning of x1 and x2 to match the one of vgg's matlab

	  x1 = 0.
	* cmake: Fixed .cc generation for cmake 2.4.
	* multiview: Added an example of how to generate .cc files with python scripts.
	  The example will have to be removed when real examples will be implemented.
	  Right now the .cc files are generated in the build directory rather than in the
	  source. This makes sense since the generated .cc are not real sources but just
	  temporal build files. It is however extrange to include files that are not in
	  the source tree. This behaviour can easily be changed.
	* numeric: Moved mean and variance computation to numeric.
	* multiview: Changed std::vector<Vec2> to Mat.
	* numeric: Moved Diag to numeric.h.
	* third_party: Moved tiny matrix product implementation to flens directory.

	  differentiated independently.
	* image: Switch downsampling to row, column notation.
	* image: Add SplitChannels() and PrintArray() functions.

	* third_party: Fix compiler warnings in release mode.
	* Cleaned Makefile.
	* correspondence: Fixed a possible uninitialized variable.
	* Added a Makefile to build both debug and release on a single command.
	* third_party: Update FLENS info.
	* third_party: Switch new FLENS back to 1-based indexing
	* third_party: Fix scalar initialization in new FLENS version.
	* third_party: Update to new FLENS; currently some tests fail because this change
	  undoes the 0-based indexing change.
	* correspondence: Use an integer compatible rounding function.
	* ui: Remove scons build files.
	* correspondence: Added image pre-smoothing on KLT tests, which greatly improves
	  precission.

	* correspondence: Added a brief note on KLT to facilitate implementation.
	* correspondence: Cleaned cmake files.
	* correspondence: Implemented BoxFilterHorizontal.
	* numeric: Fixed tests. numeric_test was failling because of 0 indexing.
	  image_test was failling because of wrong image paths.
	* correspondence: Added cmake build and testing system.

	  code.
	* correspondence: Remove hard tabs. Misc formatting.
	* correspondence: Formating.
	* numeric: Changed scons to use relative paths.
	* image: Added basic Good Features To Track detection.
	* image: Move sampling into a separate file.
	* image: Added support for Mac OS X. Builds on Leopard ui excluded.
	* image: Added a basic image pyramid.
	* image: Changed ArrayND to always own data, and added ConvolveGaussian.
	* ui: Implement convolution. Add messy code to ui/ which can display convolutions.
	* image: Add calculation of gaussian and derivative-of-gaussian kernels. Move
	  image.tcc into a cc file for faster compilation.
	* third_party: Initialize firstIndex always for arrays.
	* ui: Add PGM reading via libmv::Image to the UI experimentation code.
	* numeric: Add L1 and L2 normalize functions to numeric. Make other functions
	  inline to avoid double-definition problems.
	* third_party: Switch FLENS to use 0-based indexing by default.
	* third_party: Add lastIndex() to tinyvector.
	* ui: Experiment with libmv::Image to QImage bridge.
	* Switch tests to use gtest.
	* third_party: Get gtest to build inside libmv.
	* third_party: Initial import of GTest, Google's C++ testing framework.
	* third_party: Add GEMM function for tiny matrices.
	* image: Formating.
	* numeric: Add a tiny vector transpose.
